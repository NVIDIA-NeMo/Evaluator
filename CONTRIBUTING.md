# Contributing To NeMo Eval

### üìù Documentation

**Important**: All new key features (ex: enabling a new inference optimized library, enabling a new deployment option) must include documentation update (either a new doc or updating an existing one). This document update should:

- Explain the motivation and purpose of the feature
- Outline the technical approach and architecture
- Provide clear usage examples and instructions for users
- Document internal implementation details where appropriate

This ensures that all significant changes are well-thought-out and properly documented for future reference. Comprehensive documentation serves two critical purposes:

1. **User Adoption**: Helps users understand how to effectively use the library's features in their projects
2. **Developer Extensibility**: Enables developers to understand the internal architecture and implementation details, making it easier to modify, extend, or adapt the code for their specific use cases

Quality documentation is essential for both the usability of NeMo Export-Deploy and its ability to be customized by the community.

### Local development

Make sure to have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. You can build and inspect the documentation locally with the following commands:

```bash
cd docs/
uv run --only-group docs sphinx-autobuild . _build/html
```

## Signing Your Work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  - Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
