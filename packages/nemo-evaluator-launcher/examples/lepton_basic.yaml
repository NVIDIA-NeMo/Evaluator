# How to use: copy this file locally into a directory, say `examples`, and run
# Run this config with `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config examples/lepton_basic.yaml`.

# This example shows how to use Lepton as an execution platform with an EXISTING endpoint.
# Execution flow:
# 1. Use the pre-deployed endpoint (no deployment step)
# 2. Run evaluation tasks as parallel Lepton jobs that connect to the existing endpoint
# 3. No cleanup needed for the endpoint (since we didn't create it)

# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure your Lepton credentials: lep login
# 2. Have HuggingFace token configured for model access (UI/settings/secrets, Hugging Face)
# 3. Have ENDPOINT_API_KEY configured for the endpoint (UI/settings/secrets, Custom Secret)
# 4. Have an existing endpoint already deployed (provided in target.api_endpoint.url)
# 5. Configure storage paths in UI/Utilities/Storage and update the paths in this config

# Monitoring:
# Once the evaluation starts, you can monitor it in the Lepton UI:
# - Evaluation jobs: UI/Batch Jobs
