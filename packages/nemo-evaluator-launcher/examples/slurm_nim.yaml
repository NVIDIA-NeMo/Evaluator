# How to use:
#
# 1. copy this file locally or clone the repository
# 2. set the required values (marked with ???) or pass them via -o cli arguments, e.g.
#    -o execution.hostname=my-cluster.com -o execution.output_dir=/path/on/cluster -o execution.account=my-account
# 3. replace /path/to/nim/cache with the absolute path to the NIM cache directory on the cluster
# 4. (optional) run with 10 samples for quick testing:
#    -o ++evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=10
# 5. run full evaluation:
#    nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config path/to/slurm_nim.yaml
#
# ⚠️  WARNING:
#     Always run full evaluations (without limit_samples) for actual benchmark results.
#     Using a subset of samples is solely for testing configuration and setup.
#     Results from such test runs should NEVER be used to compare models or
#     report benchmark performance.
