# How to use: copy this file locally into a directory, say `examples`, and run
# Run this config with `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config-dir examples --config-name slurm_llama_3_1_8b_instruct`.
# For every benchmark to evaluate, it will create a Slurm job with a dedicated
# deployed model (vLLM, in this case) and the evaluation script.

# Commented out values show an example of how to override the config values from this file.

# You can also override the values in this config from CLI using dot notation.
# For example, `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config-dir examples --config-name slurm_llama_3_1_8b_instruct execution.walltime="1:00:00"`
# To see the full config, run `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config-dir examples --config-name slurm_llama_3_1_8b_instruct --dry-run`
