# How to use:
#
# 1. copy this file locally or clone the repository
# 2. set the NIM image and model name for your model
# 3. replace /path/to/nim/cache with the absolute path to the NIM cache directory on your machine
# 4. (optional) comment out limit_samples to run on the full dataset
# 5. run `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config path/to/local_nim.yaml`
#
# ⚠️  WARNING:
#     Always run full evaluations (without limit_samples) for actual benchmark results.
#     Using a subset of samples is solely for testing configuration and setup.
#     Results from such test runs should NEVER be used to compare models or
#     report benchmark performance.
