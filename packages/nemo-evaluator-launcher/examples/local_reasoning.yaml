# How to use: copy this file locally into a directory, say `examples`, and run
# Run this config with `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config-dir examples --config-name nvidia_nemotron_nano_9b_v2`.

# This is a TEST CONFIGURATION that limits all benchmarks to use only 10 samples total.
# This allows you to test your setup end-to-end quickly without running full evaluations.
#
# ⚠️  WARNING: Results from this test run should NEVER be used to compare models or
#     report benchmark performance. This is solely for testing configuration and setup.
#     Always run full evaluations (without limit_samples) for actual benchmark results.

# specify default configs for execution and deployment
