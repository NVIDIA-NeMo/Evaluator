# How to use:
#
# 1. copy this file locally or clone the repository
# 2. (optional) comment out limit_samples in the config file to run on the full dataset
# 3. run `nemo-evaluator-launcher run --config path/to/local_basic.yaml`
#
# ⚠️  WARNING:
#     Always run full evaluations (without limit_samples) for actual benchmark results.
#     Using a subset of samples is solely for testing configuration and setup.
#     Results from such test runs should NEVER be used to compare models or
#     report benchmark performance.
