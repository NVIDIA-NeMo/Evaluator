# Run Evaluations

Follow step-by-step guides for different evaluation scenarios and methodologies in NeMo Evaluation.

## Before You Start

Ensure you have:

1. Completed the initial getting started guides for {ref}`gs-install` and {ref}`gs-quickstart`.
2. Chosen a [Model Deployment](deployment-overview) option:
   - {ref}`launcher-orchestrated-deployment` (recommended)
   - {ref}`bring-your-own-endpoint` with {ref}`pytriton-deployment` or {ref}`ray-serve`
3. Reviewed the [evaluation parameters](eval-parameters) available for optimization.

:::{tab-item} Environment Requirements

```bash
# Core evaluation framework (pre-installed in NeMo container)
pip install nvidia-lm-eval==25.7.1

# Optional harnesses (install as needed)
pip install nvidia-simple-evals>=25.6      # Baseline/simple evaluations
pip install nvidia-bigcode-eval>=25.6      # Advanced code evaluation  
pip install nvidia-safety-harness>=25.6    # Safety evaluation
pip install nvidia-bfcl>=25.6              # Function calling
pip install nvidia-eval-factory-garak>=25.6  # Security scanning
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Authentication Requirements

Some evaluations require additional authentication:

```bash
# Hugging Face token for gated datasets
export HF_TOKEN="your_hf_token"

# NVIDIA Build API key for judge models (safety evaluation)
export JUDGE_API_KEY="your_nvidia_api_key"
```

## Evaluations

Select an evaluation type to measure capabilities such as text generation, log-probability scoring, code generation, safety and security, and function calling.

### Selection Guide

Use this section to choose recommended evaluations **by model type** or **by use case**.

:::{tab-item} By Model Type

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 25 75

* - Model Type
  - Recommended Evaluations
* - Base Models (Pre-trained)
  -
    -  {ref}`log-probability` - No instruction following required
    -  {ref}`text-gen` - With academic prompting
    -  Avoid chat-specific evaluations
* - Instruction-Tuned Models
  -
    -  {ref}`text-gen` - Instruction following tasks
    -  {ref}`code-generation` - Programming tasks and algorithmic problem solving
    -  {ref}`safety-security` - Alignment testing and vulnerability scanning
    -  {ref}`function-calling` - Tool use scenarios and API integration
* - Chat Models
  -
    -  All evaluation types with appropriate chat formatting
    -  Conversational benchmarks and multi-turn evaluations
```
