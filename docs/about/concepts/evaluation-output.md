# Evaluation Output

This page describes the structure and content of evaluation output files generated by NVIDIA NeMo Evaluator. The evaluation output provides comprehensive information about the evaluation run, including configuration details, results, and metadata.

## Input Configuration

The input configuration comes from the command described in the [Launcher Quickstart Guide](../../get-started/quickstart/launcher.md#quick-start), namely
```{literalinclude} ../../get-started/_snippets/launcher_full_example.sh
:language: bash
:start-after: "# [snippet-start]"
:end-before: "# [snippet-end]"
```

After running it, you can copy the artifacts folder using

```bash
nemo-evaluator-launcher debug <invocation_id> --copy-artifacts <DIR>
```
and find this file under the the `./artifacts` subfolder.


:::{note}
There are several ways to retrieve the artifacts. Above is the way that works across
executors, including e.g. `slurm`, by downloading them.
:::

For the reference purposes, we cite here the launcher config that is used in the command:

```{literalinclude} ../../../packages/nemo-evaluator-launcher/examples/local_llama_3_1_8b_instruct_limit_samples.yaml
:language: yaml
:start-after: "[docs-start-snippet]"
```

## Output Structure

The evaluation output is stored in a `results.yaml`. Below we give the output for the
command from the [Launcher Quickstart Section](../../get-started/quickstart/launcher.md#quick-start) for the `GPQA-Diamond` task.

```{literalinclude} ./_snippets/results.yaml
:language: yaml
```
:::{note}
It is instructive to compare the configuration file cited above and the resulting one.
