# Evaluation Adapters

Evaluation adapters provide a flexible mechanism for intercepting and modifying requests/responses between the evaluation harness and the model endpoint. This allows for custom processing, logging, and transformation of data during the evaluation process.

## Concepts

For a conceptual overview and architecture diagram of adapters and interceptor chains, refer to {ref}`adapters-concepts`.
